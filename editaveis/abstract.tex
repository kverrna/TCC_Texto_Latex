   According to a survey provided by Rosenfield Institute in 2012, based on the  BM\&FBovespa's request, only 1\% of the population invests in the stock market. Among the reasons for not investing, there are: (i) lack of knowledge on how to invest, and (ii) lack of resources to monthly invest. As follows, the main goal of this TCC (Course Conclusion Work) is the development of a tool that assists Brazilian citizens on making good investments. The goal of this TCC is to contribute to the financial environment by building a financial strategy tool supported by Multiagent Systems Behavioral, which is not required user knowledge related to Financial Market. Thus, the tool developed filters  financial calculations complexity commonly used in technical analysis and it delegates to the user only the decision to buy or sell. The tool's development was led by an adaptation of the Scrum agile methodology and the implementation was based on the combination of the Java programming language and the JADE framework. Object Orientation good practice was also adopted in order to reduce coupling and increase the cohesion of the source code. Furthermore, the results were qualitatively evalueted through research-action iterations.
