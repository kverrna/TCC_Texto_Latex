   According to a survey provided by Rosenfield Institute in 2012, based on the BM\&FBovespa's request, only 1\% of the population invests in the stock market. Among the reasons for not investing, there are: (i) lack of knowledge on how to invest, and (ii) lack of resources to monthly invest. As follows, the main goal of this TCC (Course Conclusion Work) is thedevelopment of a tool that assists Brazilian citizens on making good investments. The goal of this TCC is to contribute to the financial environment by building a financial strategy tool supported by Multiagent Systems Behavioral, which is not required user knowledge related to Financial Market. Thus, the tool developed abstracts complexidde financial calculations commonly used in technical analysis and delegates to the user only the decision to buy or sell. Its development was led by an adaptation of the Scrum agile methodology and the implementation was done with Java combined with Jade framework, adopting still good practice of Object Orientation to reduce coupling and increase the cohesion of the source code. The results were evaluated qualitatively through iterations research - action.
